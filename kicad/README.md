# Designing PCBs for artists and designers with KiCAD

This is an introduction to KiCAD spanning two evenings. Together, we will design a basic microcontroller board around an ATtiny microcontroller. The workshop will cover all the steps involved, from creating the schematic and designing the board to preparing it for fabrication.

## Reqiements
- You have a strong grasp of electronics and have already completed several Arduino/microcontroller projects. You are also familiar with reading schematics and understanding Ohm's law.

## Prepare for Workshop
- download KiCAD (version 9) from https://www.kicad.org/
