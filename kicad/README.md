# Designing PCBs for artists and designers with KiCAD

This is an introduction to KiCad spanning two evenings. Together, we will design a basic microcontroller board around an ATtiny microcontroller. The workshop will cover all the steps involved, from creating the schematic and designing the board to preparing it for fabrication.
